## Experience (Highlights)

### **Weka — Senior AI & Backend Engineer (Jan 2023 – Present)**
- Built a **production LLM agent** for WekaFS to execute cluster operations over SSH with strict safety controls.  
- Designed and shipped the **full retrieval pipeline** (ingestion, structured chunking, embeddings, Qdrant indexing, hybrid search).  
- Developed a GitHub Actions–triggered microservice for **selective test execution**, reducing CI time **from 50 min to 20 min**.  
- Worked across **Python**, LangChain, LangGraph, FastAPI, Qdrant, Terraform, AWS, Docker, Langfuse.

### **Innovecs — Backend Engineer (Nov 2020 – Jan 2023)**
- Built a **subscription-based billing platform** enabling transition to recurring revenue.  
- Implemented a **KYC / AML verification flow** for a crypto exchange, integrating external identity providers.  
- Technologies: Python, AWS, Kafka, PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, Redis, Flask, Django.

### **Eva — Backend Developer (Oct 2019 – Nov 2020)**
- Contributed to backend services using Python, Django, Celery, Redis, RabbitMQ, PostgreSQL.
